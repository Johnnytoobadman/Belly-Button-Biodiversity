# Belly Button Biodiversity

## OVERVIEW

### Rosa is a biological researcher in a prominent biological laboratory.  Many species of bacteria are not well studied so her role is to study bacteria that synthesizes proteins to taste like beef.  Her lab has partnered with Improbable Beef, a start up venture, to ultimately develop synthesized meat. Specifically, Rosa's goal is to study bacteria from belly buttons sampled from participants across the country.  Rosa's current project is to develop a website to allow the participants the ability to go to her website, find their ID number and see the results of her study on their belly button.

### There are 4 deliverables needed to complete the project on her webpage:

### 1. Create a horizontal bar chart which is interactive with the participant ID as they select on the webpage showing which bactieria and quantity were in their belly button.

### 2. Add to this a participant specific bubble chart with hover mode interactivity so they can see which bacteria and related quantites were on their belly button.

### 3. Add to this a guage chart to visualize the results of participants belly button washing frequency.

### 4. Add customizations to the dashboard to make it more appealing to the viewer.

### Note that a jumbotron banner has been added, a font color changed, the background color changed and the guage colors changed to go from a dirty looking belly button color to a clean looking belly button color.
